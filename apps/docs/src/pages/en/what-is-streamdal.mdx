Streamdal is an open-source data observability graph and rule-based management
tool that helps you take action. It's built on a collection of several
open-source components - a server, an SDK, and a console UI - designed to
integrate seamlessly into your code.

# <center>_Why_ Streamdal?</center>

Streamdal is not just another <a class="pkeyword" href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#observability">observability</a>
or data management tool. It's a philosophy for a way of thinking and working
with data that prioritizes a few concepts:

- Real-time insights... that are _truly_ **real-time** and not _"real-time"_
- Flexibility
- Ease of use
- Preventing issues

Read more about this philosophy and design choice in our brief
[manifesto](https://streamdal.com/manifesto/).

## Deployment
- **Quick Setup**: Check out our
[quickstart guide](/en/getting-started/quickstart/) to get Streamdal up in no
time.
- **Streamdal in Production**: For more robust requirements, refer to our
[deployment guide](/en/guides/instrumentation/).

## Console UI
Dive into the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui) to explore metrics,
schema views, and a <a class="pkeyword" href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#data-graph">Data Graph</a> of your services.

## CLI
It's a must-have tool for developers seeking a streamlined experience, or for
those who just prefer a terminal. Check out the
[CLI README](https://github.com/streamdal/cli#readme) to quickly get up and
running with this.

## SDK
Connect your applications up to Streamdal via the
[SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/).

After getting familiar with the
[general instrumentation](/en/guides/instrumentation) guide, explore the
specific SDKs we _currently_ offer:

- [Go](/en/sdks/go)
- [Node](/en/sdks/node)
- [Python](/en/sdks/python)

Stay tuned for more SDKs in the pipeline!

In 2017, facing growing cybersecurity threats, New York's Department of 
Financial Services introduced <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/industry_guidance/cybersecurity" target="_blank">Title 23 NYCRR 500: Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies</a> 
_(NYCRR-500)_. This regulation targets financial entities operating in the 
state, ensuring the protection of customer data and IT systems of institutions 
like state-chartered banks, mortgage brokers, and insurers.

Streamdal will strengthen compliance with this regulation, and enable anyone to 
enforce data policies on real-time data.

## Streamdal's Approach

You can leverage Streamdal for:

**Protecting Data:** You can establish specific <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a> and <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#pipeline-or-ruleset" class="pkeyword">pipelines</a> for data 
that obfuscate or redact PII, and check for plaintext passwords or other 
sensitive information. Data that is past its retention period can be blocked 
from accidentally being introduced or reintroduced into critical environments. 

**Enforcing Data Policies:** From the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/), you can create rules that 
data must pass in order to continue flowing through your systems. You can tap 
into real-time data with [Tail](/en/guides/tail/) to follow the flow of data through your system 
and ensure compliance.

**Continuous Monitoring:** The [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) can also notify you on anomalous data 
activity, such as unexpected increases or decreases in flow, or a sudden influx 
of violations. 

The [observability](/en/resources-support/glossary/#observability) the [Data Graph](/en/core-components/console-ui/#data-graph) and [Tail](/en/guides/tail/) provide can also help security and 
operational teams understand how code handles data in real time. This 
drives better communication with data handling processes and faster response 
to threats in real time.

> **Coming Soon**: A visual guide on setting up NYCRR-500-specific rules in the 
[Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/).

## Regulatory Insights

We wanted to make researching the relevant data regulations easier and give a 
better idea of where Streamdal could be the most impactful for your 
organization. In most cases, the combination of the observability and data 
governance capabilities will ensure successful compliance. 

While more sections could be applicable, below are two taken from the 
_Title 23 NYCRR Part 500[^1]_ along with how Streamdal can help with data 
compliance:

| § Sections | How Streamdal helps comply |
|-|-|
| § 500.3 Cybersecurity Policy | The Streamdal [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) can ensure that data in motion complies with your organization's data security policies by filtering, alerting, or rejecting data based on content [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step). For example, you can implement [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) to alert on and reject data that contain plaintext passwords or other sensitive information, and monitor for potential violation. |
| § 500.13  Limitations on Data Retention | Streamdal can assist with limitations on data retention through the creation of [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) in the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/). You can get notified when producers and consumers are handling PI that is past its retention period (time fields), or completely block non-compliant data from being reintroduced into critical environments. <br /><br />[Rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) can also be set up to strip, restrict, obfuscate, and mask data helping enforce data policies around retention.

    _The NY DFS (Department of Financial Services) states that 
    "non-continuous monitoring of Information Systems, such as through periodic 
    manual review of logs and firewall configurations, would not be considered 
    to constitute "effective continuous monitoring" for purposes of 23 NYCRR 
    500.05[^1]."_

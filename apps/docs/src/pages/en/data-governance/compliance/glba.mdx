<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/privacy-security/gramm-leach-bliley-act" target="_blank">The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</a> 
_(GLBA)_ covers a wide range of financial institutions. A significant factor in 
complying with the GLBA is safeguarding sensitive data, which 
Streamdal can help with.

## Streamdal's Approach

You can leverage Streamdal for:

**Automation with _'Risk Assessments'_ for all your data:** While many 
developers might be satisfied with just the [CLI](/en/guides/tail#cli) for data <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#observability" class="pkeyword">observability</a>, 
security professionals or other operational and non-technical parts of an 
organization can access the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/) to get an always up-to-date 
view of all the data that moves in their systems. 

Streamdal adds significant automation for risk assessments on data, and equips 
organizations with new powerful mechanisms to help surface 
_'unknown unknowns'_ in their data security.

**Safeguards for controlling identified risks>:** Using Streamdal to implement granular 
governance <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#step-or-rule" class="pkeyword">rules</a> on data moving 
across your systems will bolster your methods of risk 
mitigation. This can _wildly limit_ the "unauthorized disclosure, misuse, 
alteration, destruction, or other compromise" of sensitive information.

**Adjusting Data Policies:** As your systems mature and require greater data 
governance, Streamdal allows you to easily change how data is handled in real 
time. For example, you could begin obfuscating or de-identifying parts of 
sensitive data, or adjusting the boundaries where data can reside all in real 
time, and without re-compiling or changes to CI/CD.

[Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/).

## Regulatory Insights

We wanted to make researching the relevant data regulations easier and give a 
better idea of where Streamdal could be the most impactful for your 
organization. In most cases, the combination of the observability and data 
governance capabilities will ensure successful compliance. 

While more sections could be applicable, below are a few taken from the 
_GLBA[^1]_ as archived in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations along with how 
Streamdal can help with data compliance:

| § Sections | How Streamdal helps comply |
|-|-|
| § 314.3 Standards for safeguarding customer information (a) | The Streamdal [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) can ensure that data in motion complies with your organization's data security policies by filtering, alerting, or rejecting data based on content [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step). <br /> <br />For example, you can implement [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) to reject data that contain plaintext passwords or other sensitive information. |
| § 314.4 Elements (c)(1)(2)(4)(6)  | Weaving the Streamdal [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) `process()` into all of your services means that regardless of scale, you will always have an up-to-date view in the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/) of the flow of data in your systems, making discovery and management simple and easy. <br /> <br />Based on the [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) you can set up, the [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) can determine and restrict who can consume and access data, fortifying data security. These same [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) can also restrict the movement of data once it has passed its retention period, effectively ensuring data that is scheduled for secure disposal is not re-introduced into other environments. |
| § 314.4 Elements (g) | The [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) you create in the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/) can be as flexible and dynamic as you need, along with the ability to make adjustments on the fly and in real-time. For instance, if it is discovered that there is a new vulnerability in storage at an on-prem server, you can easily attach [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) to your [producers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer) and [consumers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer) that prevent sensitive data from entering that server. |

    _The Privacy Rule guards "nonpublic personal information" (NPI), which is 
    private financial data collected by institutions unless it's public. NPI 
    doesn't include info deemed lawfully public unless the person opts to 
    keep it private, like an unlisted phone number[^2]._

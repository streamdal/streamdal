Streamdal uses a variety of terms that can have various meanings across 
industries and use cases. This section exists to help clear up any ambiguity 
around Streamdal [core-components](/en/core-components/overview/) or 
functionality.

### <span class="pkeyword">Audience</span>

A term we have come up with that identifies a specific service + operation 
type (`consumer` or `producer`), name for the operation type and component. 
The audience can be referenced using the following slug:
  - `$service_name:$operation_type:$operation_name:$component_name`

The only exposure to the `audience` concept that an 
[SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) has is via the `NewAudience()` internal 
[gRPC](/en/engineering/grpc/) method which is used by the 
[SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) to announce the existence of a new audience. 
The `audience` contains the elements needed to be able to draw the most basic 
[Data Graph](/en/core-components/console-ui/#data-graph) entry, eg: `service` ↔ `producer` ↔ 
`component`.

### <span class="pkeyword">Condition</span>

A `condition` is associated with a step. It defines how the 
[SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) should react to the result of a step 
execution. The condition might be configured to **ABORT** the `pipeline` if a 
`step` results in a failure or an error.

### <span class="pkeyword">Consumer</span>

A consumer <img src={consumer_icon} class="inlineimg" /> generally refers to 
any function, method, or component that takes input (or data) and does 
something with it. A consumer `consumes` data, but may not necessarily 
produce output. 

For example, a function that logs data to the console, writes data to a file, 
or updates a UI element can be considered a consumer because it acts on the 
data but doesn't give you something to work with afterward.

Sometimes a consumer will take in data, process it, and produce new or 
transformed data - this hybrid of "consumer/producer" functionality is 
sometimes referred to as a "transformer."

### <span class="pkeyword">Destination</span>
A destination refers to any location, system, or facility where data is sent, 
stored, or displayed after it has been processed or generated by an application. 

While sources provide or feed data into systems (input), destinations are where 
data ends up (output). Some examples of destinations would be:

- Databases
- Files
- API Endpoints
- Message Queues
- User Interfaces
- Data Warehouses & Data Lakes
- Cloud-based Storage Solutions
- Email and Notification Systems
- IoT or External Devices
- Logging Systems

### <span class="pkeyword">Firewall for Data</span>

Streamdal does not configure/reconfigure or affect your network firewall 
settings. When we say "firewall for data," it is a figure of speech to convey 
the power that creating <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a> and attaching pipelines to the flow of your 
data establishes. 

Our [data governance](/en/data-governance/overview/) sections somewhat cover 
these beta functionalities, and will be much more verbose once these features 
are production.

### <span class="pkeyword">Observability</span>

Observability can be a really loaded term, which is why we also cover this in 
our [FAQ](/en/resources-support/faq/) and have [a whole section](/en/engineering/observability/) 
dedicated to it. Depending on what you're working with or who you're speaking 
to, it can mean many different things. 

When we say observability, we mean:  
> _The ability to simply see the actual real-time data, its schema, and the 
services generating data or interacting with it._

DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) also has a good definition on 
[observability](https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/technical/monitoring-and-observability/#:~:text=Observability%20is%20tooling%20or%20a%20technical%20solution%20that%20allows%20teams%20to%20actively%20debug%20their%20system.%20Observability%20is%20based%20on%20exploring%20properties%20and%20patterns%20not%20defined%20in%20advance.) 
within this context, which defines it as:  
  
> _...tooling or a technical solution that allows teams to actively debug their 
system. Observability is based on exploring properties and patterns not defined 
in advance._

We see [Tail](/en/guides/tail/) as a crucial part of this, and the primary 
function enabling data observability with Streamdal. Here are the following 
features we consider as "observability" features:

- [Tail](/en/guides/tail/)
- [Data Graph](/en/core-components/console-ui#data-graph)
- [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/)
- [Schemas](/en/core-components/overview/#console-ui-the-observability-command-center)


### <span class="pkeyword">Pipeline</span> or <span class="pkeyword">Ruleset</span>

A `pipeline` is a set of `steps` and conditions. A user would configure one or 
more steps for a specific producer or consumer - the result would be a pipeline 
(that is sent to the [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) client via [gRPC](/en/engineering/grpc/)).


### <span class="pkeyword">Producer</span> 
A producer <img src={producer_icon} class="inlineimg" />  typically refers to a 
function, method, or component that generates or `produces` data. It can be 
thought of as a source of data in a data flow pipeline.

Sometimes a producer will take in data, process it, and produce new or 
transformed data - this hybrid of "producer/consumer" functionality is 
sometimes referred to as a "transformer."

### <span class="pkeyword">Service</span>

A service can have various meanings depending on the context, but it generally 
refers to a distinct functional unit that provides specific functionalities or 
operations that are well-defined and independent.

Here is some common contexts in which the term "service" might be used:

- Web Services
- Microservices
- Windows Services (or Daemon in UNIX)
- Cloud Services (Like IaaS, PaaS, or SaaS services)

Specifically to Streamdal, when [instrumenting](/en/guides/instrumentation/) 
the [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/), `ServiceName` is a required field to be 
defined, which gives your "service" a name on the 
[Data Graph](/en/core-components/console-ui#data-graph). Our 
[Golang example](/en/core-components/sdk/#golang-sdk-example) shows how this 
works.

### <span class="pkeyword">Shim</span>

A [wrapper library](/en/core-components/libraries-shims/) for popular libraries 
that incorporate the usage of our [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) to simplify 
integration and adoption of Streamdal.

- **Example**: we would develop a shim for Python’s HTTP request library called 
`requests`. This shim would be a lightweight fork of `requests` that would call 
on `streamdal_sdk.Process(..)` whenever the user would POST, PUT, DELETE, or GET 
data. The shim simplifies and speeds up initial onboarding and integration.

### <span class="pkeyword">Source</span>

A source refers to any location, system, or facility where data is generated, 
stored, or maintained and from which data can be retrieved for further use or 
processing. 

Data sources can range from databases to external APIs, and their nature can be 
both static or dynamic. Some examples of a data source would be:

- Databases
- Files
- APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)
- Message Queues (Such as RabbitMQ, SQS, Kafka, etc)
- Streaming Data
- Data Warehouses & Data Lakes
- Cloud-based Storage Solutions
- ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) Systems
- Content Management Systems (CMS)

### <span class="pkeyword">Rule</span> or <span class="pkeyword">Step</span>

A `rule` (or a `step`) is a single unit of “work” that the 
[SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) will run against a payload.
- **Example**: The user might create a step that ensures that the payload always 
contains a field called `id` which MUST be of the `uuid` format.

### <span class="pkeyword">WASM</span>

`WASM` is <a href="https://webassembly.org/" target="_blank">WebAssembly</a>. 
We use this technology in `steps`, and it's a 
[principal element of Streamdal functionality](/en/resources-support/faq/#16-what-role-does-wasm-play-in-streamdal). 

A step consists of a configuration 
(ie. what is the name of this step, what <span class="pkeyword">WASM</span> 
function should it run with what parameters, etc.) - AND the actual WASM bytes 
that will be executed by the [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/).

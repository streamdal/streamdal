### <span class="hidden">1. What is Streamdal?</span>
<li>
<Accordion 
title="What is Streamdal?">
<p>
Streamdal is an open source <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#observability" class="pkeyword">observability</a> tool. 
<br />
It's comprised of a 
[server](/en/core-components/server/), a UI, and a bunch of <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#wasm" class="pkeyword">WASM</a>-powered 
[SDKs](/en/core-components/sdk/). By using our SDK and deploying it’s server, 
you’ll get a dynamic [graph](/en/core-components/console-ui#data-graph) of your 
<a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer" class="pkeyword">producers</a> 
and <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer" class="pkeyword">consumers</a> 
as they scale up and down, with the ability to tap in and view all the 
real-time data flowing through them with [Tail](/en/guides/tail/). 
</p>
<br />
<p>
You can use Tail from the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/). Or, 
for those who prefer a terminal, you can use the 
[CLI](/en/what-is-streamdal/#-cli). 💋
</p>
<br />
<p>
The stuff you can use to modify your "in-flight" data such as stripping PII, 
masking, obfuscating, or validating data is of a certain format or structure, 
etc is done with <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a>. 
Currently, rules and the 
preventive/[data governance](/en/data-governance/overview/) features are in 
beta. 
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hidden">2. How do I use Streamdal, and where is it deployed?</span>

<li>
<Accordion 
title="How do I use Streamdal, and where is it deployed?">
<p>
1. Import our SDK for your language.
2. Weave the `Process()` method into the fabric of your code where 
data production or consumption takes place.
3. Deploy the Streamdal server where the services using the Streamdal SDK are 
running.
</p>
<br />
<p>
Check out the [quickstart guide](/en/getting-started/quickstart/).
</p>
<br />
<p> 
You can find more details in our guides on 
[instrumentation](/en/guides/instrumentation/) and 
[deployment](/en/guides/deployment/).
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hidden">3. What language SDKs do you support?</span>

<li>
<Accordion 
title="What language SDKs do you support?">
<p>
Currently we support: 
<br />
<ul>
<li>[Go](/en/language-support/go/)</li>
<li>[Node](/en/language-support/node/)</li>
<li>[Python](/en/language-support/python/)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br />
<p>
We plan on adding more language support in the future, along with 
libraries/[shims](/en/resources-support/glossary/#shim) for easier 
instrumentation. Check out the 
[roadmap](/en/resources-support/roadmap/) for more details.
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hidden">4. What data sources and destinations are supported?</span>
<li>
<Accordion 
title="What data sources and destinations are supported?">
<p>
Any <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#source" class="pkeyword">source</a>, and any <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#destination" class="pkeyword">destination</a>. 
<br />
The way Streamdal is instrumented, there isn't 
a need for connectors or interfacing with various API's. The [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) uses a 
`Process()` method that is wrapped around the parts of your code where data 
production and consumption take place.
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hidden">5. Will this cause HTTP bottlenecks, or impact my app performance in any way?</span>

<li>
<Accordion 
title="Will this cause HTTP bottlenecks, or impact my app performance in any 
way?">
<p>
The work all happens <span class="yhighlight">locally</span> in the SDK, 
and on the client. The server component is just there to configure things on 
the client by shipping down <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a> created in the Console UI. 

<br />

This happens with only a negligible resource hit to the client (usally \<0.1ms, 
thanks to 
<a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#wasm" class="pkeyword">WASM</a>). 
There is no sending data, or shipping logs, metrics, or traces anywhere.

<br />

Check out our 
[benchmark tests](https://github.com/streamdal/snitch-detective/blob/main/src/test_bench.rs) 
on GitHub.
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hidden">6. Why aren't my services, producers, or consumers showing up on the data graph?</span>

<li>
<Accordion 
title="Why aren't my services, producers, or consumers showing up on the data 
graph?">
<p>
In order for the data graph to visually populate services:
</p>
<br />
<p>
1. The [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) should be imported and properly 
instrumented for your language. See the 
[Golang example](/en/core-components/sdk/#golang-sdk-example) on importing the 
SDK.
2. The [server](/en/core-components/server/) needs to be accessible by the SDK. 
If you have confirmed the containers are up, try running 
`curl <streamdal-server>:<endpoints>`. Check out the various 
[endpoints exposed](/en/core-components/server#multi-faceted-api-endpoints) 
by the server components for further testing. 
   - The `STREAMDAL_URL` default 
  [environment variable](/en/core-components/sdk/#environment-variables-configuring-the-sdk) 
  value is 
  `localhost:9090`. If you are running the server somewhere other than where 
  your instrumented services live _(which is generally not recommended)_, you 
  will need to update this value to the correct address.
</p>
</Accordion>

### <span class="hidden">7. I see Rules in the Console UI, but they are listed as `Beta.` Can I use this feature?</span>

<li>
<Accordion 
title="I see Rules in the Console UI, but they are listed as `Beta.` Can I use 
this feature?">
<p>
<a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">Rules</a> 
are currently in beta along with the other 
[data governance](/en/data-governance/overview/) features of Streamdal.

<br />

They are being tested by a select group of contributors, companies, and design 
partners. 

<br />

_These features aren't production-ready!_ But, if you would like 
to get test access or become a design partner, 
[contact us](mailto:support@streamdal.com) or hit us up in our  
[community](/en/resources-support/community/).

</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hidden">8. What is open source, what is free, and what is paid? Will this change in the future?</span>

{/* TODO: Add launch manifesto link here once available */}
<li>
<Accordion 
title="What is open source, what is free, and what is paid? Will this change in 
the future?">
<p>
The <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#observability" class="pkeyword">observability</a> 
aspects and features of Streamdal, including [Tail](/en/guides/tail/), will 
always be free and [open source](/en/resources-support/open-source/) using the 
Apache License v2.0. 

<br />

Currently, the data governance features are in beta, but once they are fully 
fleshed out and production-ready, they _may_ be a paid feature. We haven't 
decided which parts of the governance features might need to be paid. 

<br />

Regardless of how that decision pans out, we will not be rug-pulling anything 
we put out as open source.

<br />

Check out our 
[launch manifesto](#link-to-launch-manifesto) for details on this design 
decision.

### <span class="hidden">9. When will you support `<this-feature-language-or-library>`?</span>

<li>
<Accordion 
title="When will you support <this-feature-language-or-library>?">
<p>
Our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/streamdal/projects/1) is publicly 
available on GitHub.

<br />

[community](/en/resources-support/community/) and let us know!
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hidden">10. How do I maintain the Data Graph?</span>

<li>
<Accordion 
title="How do I maintain the Data Graph?">
<p>
The [Data Graph](/en/core-components/console-ui#data-graph) is _real-time_ and _dynamic_. 

<br />
What that means is so long as the 
[server component](/en/core-components/server/)
is running, and new <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#service" class="pkeyword">services</a> are instrumented with the 
[SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/), _the Data Graph will not require maintenance_. 

<br />

The view you 
get will always be an accurate representation of data flowing through your 
systems regardless of scale.
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hidden">11. How do I manage schemas?</span>

<li>
<Accordion 
title="How do I manage schemas?">
<p>
Currently, there is no need to manage schemas. Once you have instrumented the 
[SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/), you will be able to view the active schemas of 
data throughout your systems. 

<br />

When you weave the `Process()` method throughout your code, behind the scenes 
the SDK will infer and decode schemas, and present them in a human-readable 
format via the [console UI](en/core-components/console-ui/).

<br />

We have big plans to expand schemas in the future. This could include tools, 
management capabilities, or functionality such as history and diff views.

<br />

Reference the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/streamdal/projects/1/views/9) 
for more information.
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hidden">12. What is Tail?</span>

<li>
<Accordion 
title="What is Tail?">
<p>
Tail gets its name from the Unix command and argument `tail -f`. 

<br />

It is a feature that can be used via the 
[Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/) (or 
[CLI](/en/what-is-streamdal/#-cli)) which will allow you to tap into any of 
your <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer" class="pkeyword">producers</a> 
or <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer" class="pkeyword">consumers</a> 
and view the real-time data flowing through them.

<br />

Because schemas are inferred and decoded, you'll be able to observe your data 
in a human-readable format.
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hidden">13. What are Shims?</span>

<li>
<Accordion 
title="What are Shims?">
<p>
A <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#shim" class="pkeyword">Shim</a> is a 
'wrapper library' for popular libraries that incorporate the usage of our SDK 
to simplify the integration and adoption of Streamdal. 

<br />

Our primary focus has been on the SDKs, and shims will land sometime in the 
future. Check the 
roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/streamdal/projects/1/views/9) to see when they 
could be added.
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hidden">14. What is Observability?</span>
{/* TODO: Add launch manifesto link here once available */}
<li>
<Accordion 
title="What is Observability?">
<p>
<span class="pkeyword">Observability</span> can be a really loaded term, which 
is why we also define it in our [glossary](/en/resources-support/glossary#observability) and 
have [a whole section dedicated](/en/engineering/observability/) to it. 
Depending on what you're working with or who you're speaking to, it can mean 
many different things. 
</p>
<br />
<p>
When we say observability, we mean:  
> _The ability to simply see the actual real-time data, its schema, and the 
services generating data or interacting with it._
</p>
<br />
<p>
DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) also has a good definition on 
[observability](https://dora.dev/devops-capabilities/technical/monitoring-and-observability/#:~:text=Observability%20is%20tooling%20or%20a%20technical%20solution%20that%20allows%20teams%20to%20actively%20debug%20their%20system.%20Observability%20is%20based%20on%20exploring%20properties%20and%20patterns%20not%20defined%20in%20advance.) 
within this context, which defines it as:  
  
> _...tooling or a technical solution that allows teams to actively debug their 
system. Observability is based on exploring properties and patterns not defined 
in advance._
</p>
<br />
<p>
We see [Tail](/en/guides/tail/) as a crucial part of this, and the primary 
function enabling data observability with Streamdal. Here are the following 
features we consider as "observability" features:
</p>
<br />
<p>
- [Tail](/en/guides/tail/)
- [Data Graph](/en/core-components/console-ui#data-graph)
- [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/)
- [Schemas](/en/core-components/overview/#console-ui-the-observability-command-center)

<br />

👆That list is subject to additions over time, _and not subtractions_. Check 
out our [manifesto](#) for more information on this design choice.

### <span class="hidden">15. What is WASM?</span>

<li>
<Accordion 
title="What is WASM?">
<p>
<a href="/en/resources-support/glossary#wasm" class="pkeyword">WASM</a> is [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hidden">16. What role does WASM play in Streamdal?</span>

<li>
<Accordion 
title="What role does WASM play in Streamdal?">
<p>
We make significant use of <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary#wasm" class="pkeyword">WASM</a>.

<br />

Rules are supported by WASM 100%. Schema inference, rules, and any sort of 
business logic is going to be executed by WASM in the SDK.

<br />

The reason we're able to have such a low impact on any given client's resources, 
usually less than 0.1ms, is because it's being executed via WASM. Check out 
more information on this in our [WASM repo](https://github.com/streamdal/wasm).

</Accordion>
</li>

### <span class="hidden">17. How do I contribute or become a design partner?</span>

<li>
<Accordion 
title="How do I contribute or become a design partner?">
<p>
Streamdal is open-source using the Apache License v2.0.

### <span class="hidden">18. Does Streamdal support Protobuf or other binary encoding formats?</span>

<li>
<Accordion 
title="Does Streamdal support Protobuf or other binary encoding formats?">
<p>
We are unabashed fans of and **experts with Protobuf**. It's used in the primary 
API - we use it everywhere. We have even released previous open source tools 
like [plumber](https://github.com/streamdal/plumber) which has extensive 
protobuf support.

<br />

Right now **Streamdal will only work with JSON or non-binary data**, but we have 
plans to add support in the near future. 

<br />

Check out our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/streamdal/projects/1/views/9) 
for updates.

### <span class="hidden">19. What are the numbers on the lines between my services and backends?</span>

<li>
<Accordion 
title="What are the numbers on the lines between my services and backends?">
<p>
Those numbers are throughput details for the edges in those particular groups of 
components. 

<br />

In the screenshot below, the arrows are pointing to the 
<a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer" class="pkeyword">producer</a> 
throughput details of the `welcome-service` <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#service" class="pkeyword">service</a>:

<br />

<center><img src={edge} alt="Streamdal producer edge details" /></center>
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>


### <span class="hidden">20. What is live/real-time in the app?</span>

<li>
<Accordion 
title="What is live/real-time in the app?">
<p>
Nearly everything.

<br />

The app is always connected to the backend and the [server](/en/core-components/server/). It will receive and 
react to every update that happens on the server:
<br />
- Throughput information
- the [Data Graph](/en/core-components/console-ui#data-graph) (i.e. when a new SDK is instrumented and the `Process()` is called, it will start showing up on the data graph)
- [Tail](/en/guides/tail/)
- Schemas
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>


### <span class="hidden">21. I see direction indicators on the lines. What are those for?</span>

<li>
<Accordion 
title="I see direction indicators on the lines. What are those for?">
<p>
These are very important. They show the direction of the flow of data.

<br />

- Going up means it's a read, and is a <img src={consumer_icon} class="inlineimg" /> <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer" class="pkeyword">consumer</a>
- Going down means it's a write, and is a <img src={producer_icon} class="inlineimg" /> <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer" class="pkeyword">producer</a>
</p>
</Accordion>
</li>


### <span class="hidden">22. I saw that I must pass a ServiceName, ComponentName, OperationType, and OperationName in the SDK - what are those?</span>

<li>
<Accordion 
title="I saw that I must pass a ServiceName, ComponentName, OperationType, and OperationName in the SDK - what are those?">
<p>
We refer to these as the 
<a href="/en/resources-support/glossary#audience" class="pkeyword">audience</a>, 
which identifies a specific service + operation type 
(<a href="/en/resources-support/glossary#consumer" class="pkeyword">consume</a> or <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary#producer" class="pkeyword">producer</a>), 
and name for the operation type and component.

<br />
You will always see these. There is an envar for some of them, but these are 
declared when the [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) is 
[instrumented](/en/guides/instrumentation/).

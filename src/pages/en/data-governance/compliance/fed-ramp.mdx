_(FedRAMP)_ mandates cloud services to meet consistent security and quality 
standards. Achieving and maintaining this certification can be complex, but 
Streamdal can help simplify the process.

## Streamdal's Approach

Leverage Streamdal for:

⛨ **<span class="ykeyword">Data Protection</span>**: You can implement rules on data to consistently govern 
how federal information is processed. The SDK can help prevent accidental transmission or unauthorized access 
by disallowing data from leaving its defined boundaries. 

By creating <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#step-or-rule" class="pkeyword">rules</a> and attaching <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#pipeline-or-ruleset" class="pkeyword">pipelines</a> to <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer" class="pkeyword">producers</a> and <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer" class="pkeyword">consumers</a>, you can 
ensure development environments are not processing, storing, or transmitting federal information.

🚓 **<span class="ykeyword">Incident Response</span>**: Streamline your response to security incidents by 
setting up automated workflows that aid your team in rapidly addressing threats.

🔍 **<span class="ykeyword">Continuous Monitoring</span>**: Implement rules to consistently monitor cloud 
environments, detecting and alerting on any unauthorized access or anomalous 
activities that might signify a potential security threat.

## Regulatory Insights

Understanding various laws, regulations, and compliance guidelines can be 
daunting. We always recommend developing your data policies with a legal 
department, security/GRC consultant, or your friendly neighborhood DevOps 
professional 😄.

The purpose of this section is to make researching these regulations easier and 
to give a better idea of where Streamdal could be the most impactful for your 
organization. In most cases, <u>the combination of</u> the always free and open 
source aspects of Streamdal and the data governance capabilities will ensure 
successful compliance. 

While more key concepts should be applicable, below are two taken from the 
_FedRAMP CSO's Impact Levels[^1]_ along with how Streamdal can help with data 
compliance:

| Key Concepts | How Streamdal helps comply |
|-|-|
| #1 (All Impact levels): Defining Your Authorization Boundary in the Cloud | Streamdal can play a key part in defining and protecting data boundaries for the authorizing officials operating in your systems. You can write [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) for controlling access to data, and [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) to protect the flow of all federal information and metadata from leaving its boundaries. |
| #4 (FR-High): Interconnections in the Cloud | Streamdal will significantly uncomplicate the disclosing process to the AO (Agency of Authorizing Authority). Without necessarily defining [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step), simply using the [observability](/en/resources-support/glossary/#observability) Streamdal offers will surface all of the data handling portions of your systems. |

    _Did you know:_ 
    
    _An <u>API that calls data from an external source</u>, 
    <u>IaaS that a PaaS or SaaS resides upon</u>, or external systems that 
    provide <u>audit logging</u>, <u>vulnerability scanning</u>, or 
    <u>ticketing systems</u> are all examples of external services that could 
    impact the CIA (confidentiality, integrity, or availability) of federal 
    information._

A system’s category is dependent on the potential impact on an agency’s assets and operations should their information and information systems be compromised through unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. These are the standards Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) must employ to ensure their services meet the minimum security requirements for the data processed, stored, and transmitted._

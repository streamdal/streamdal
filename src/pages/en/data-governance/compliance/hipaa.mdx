  <p style="font-weight: lighter;">The data compliance features of Streamdal 
  are currently in beta, and being tested with a select group of contributors, 
  companies, and design partners. If you would like to participate in the beta,

The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html" target="_blank">Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996</a> 
_(HIPAA)_ is a U.S. federal regulation that mandates national guidelines to 
safeguard confidential patient health data from unauthorized disclosure 
without the patient's awareness or approval. Streamdal can help keep data in
compliance with HIPAA requirements.

## <img src={beta} alt="Beta" style="display: inline" /> Streamdal's Approach

You can leverage Streamdal for:

⚕️ **<span class="ykeyword">PHI Data Integrity</span>:** Streamdal can help ensure only expected and valid data reaches a <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#destination" class="pkeyword">destination</a>, and will quarantine "bad data" for repair. You can set up <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a> to ensure consistent data and alerts on violations, regardless of where it is <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer" class="pkeyword">produced</a> or <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer" class="pkeyword">consumed</a>. 

🎭 **<span class="ykeyword">De-identifying PHI</span>:** Almost all of the sensitive PHI fields can be found in the default <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rule</a> selections, such as `social security number`, `IP address`, `telephone number`, etc which can be filtered for. 

With these <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a>, you can create reusable <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#pipeline-or-ruleset" class="pkeyword">pipelines</a> in the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/) for ensuring PHI is always properly de-identified in real time.

🦺 **<span class="ykeyword">Ensuring Real-time Safeguards</span>:** With the combination of <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a> and reusable <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#pipeline-or-ruleset" class="pkeyword">pipelines</a>, you can ensure that PHI is not introduced into environments where it should not be. You can control which <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer" class="pkeyword">producers</a> or <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer" class="pkeyword">consumers</a> can interact with PHI, and effectively enforce data boundaries in real time.

[Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/).

## Regulatory Insights

Understanding various laws, regulations, and compliance guidelines can be 
daunting. We always recommend developing your data policies with a legal 
department, security/GRC consultant, or your friendly neighborhood DevOps 
professional 😄.

The purpose of this section is to make researching these regulations easier and 
to give a better idea of where Streamdal could be the most impactful for your 
organization. In most cases, <u>the combination of</u> the always free and 
[open source](/en/resources-support/open-source/) aspects of Streamdal and the 
[data governance](/en/data-governance/overview/) capabilities will ensure 
successful compliance. 

While more sections could be applicable, below are a few taken from the 
_HIPAA Administrative Simplification Regulation Text[^1]_ along with how 
Streamdal can help with data compliance:

| § Sections | How Streamdal helps comply |
|-|-|
| § 164.312 (c)(1)(e)(2)(i) Standard: Integrity, Implementation specifications, & Integrity controls (Addressable).| Streamdal allows you to monitor and protect PHI by enforcing [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) on [services](/en/resources-support/glossary/#service) that interact with this sensitive data in real time. You can enforce quality standards to ensure information is not improperly altered or destroyed in flight, as well as restrict access to specific [producers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer) and [consumers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer). |
| § 164.514 Other requirements relating to uses and disclosures of protected health information. | Almost all of the sensitive fields listed in this HIPAA section on the parameters of creating de-identified data sets are default value [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) you can select and obfuscate/de-identify with Streamdal. You can effectively enforce the quality standards for _all_ your de-identified data sets, as well as ensure this data is HIPAA compliant before it reaches a [destination](/en/resources-support/glossary/#destination). |
| § 164.530 Administrative requirements (c)(1) Standard: Safeguards. | While Streamdal does not encrypt data, the combination of [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) and functions that can be created in the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/) can help ensure your data is protected in-flight, <u>before it reaches rest.</u> You can block certain producers and consumers from interacting with data, thus creating boundaries for data to ensure PHI is not accidentally introduced into unauthorized locations. |

    _Did you know:_
    
    _The HIPAA Privacy Rule doesn't dictate how long medical records should be 
    kept; this is typically determined by State laws. However, it does mandate 
    that entities covered by HIPAA protect the privacy of medical records and 
    other PHI for as long as they hold that information, including during its 
    disposal[^2]._

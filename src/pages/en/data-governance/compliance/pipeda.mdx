Canada's <a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/" target="_blank">Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</a> 
_(PIPEDA)_ regulates how private businesses handle personal information during 
commercial activities. It aims to strike a balance between individual privacy 
rights and the operational needs of businesses to utilize such data.

Streamdal is a powerful tool to help keep your data compliant with PIPEDA 
principals.

## Streamdal's Approach

You can leverage Streamdal for:

🚷 **<span class="ykeyword">Limiting Data Collection</span>:** The Streamdal [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) can enforce <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a> on <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer" class="pkeyword">consumers</a> and <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer" class="pkeyword">producers</a> to reject data or alert you if it contains more personal data than what is necessary, ensuring data minimization.

🎯 **<span class="ykeyword">Data Accuracy</span>:** Along with the <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a> you can set up to limit the collection of data, the [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) can validate and filter for specific fields of data.

**For example**: you could set up <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a> to validate fields such as `time`, `name`,  `social security number`, and much more to ensure information is present and accurate. 

🚓 **<span class="ykeyword">Enforcing Data Policies and Safeguards</span>:** Because the [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) executes your <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step" class="pkeyword">rules</a> and <a href="/en/resources-support/glossary/#pipeline-or-ruleset" class="pkeyword">pipelines</a> as data is being `produced` or `consumed`, you will be able to mask, obfuscate, and otherwise enforce PII handling policies before it moves through your system - and every step afterward as needed.

## Regulatory Insights

Understanding various laws, regulations, and compliance guidelines can be 
daunting. We always recommend developing your data policies with a legal 
department, security/GRC consultant, or your friendly neighborhood DevOps 
professional 😄.

The purpose of this section is to make researching these regulations easier and 
to give a better idea of where Streamdal could be the most impactful for your 
organization. In most cases, <u>the combination of</u> the always free and 
[open source](/en/resources-support/open-source/) aspects of Streamdal and the 
[data governance](/en/data-governance/overview/) capabilities will ensure 
successful compliance. 

While more principles could be applicable, below are a few taken from 
The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada's _"PIPEDA in brief"[^1]_ 
along with how Streamdal can help with data compliance:

| Principals | How Streamdal Helps Comply |
|-|-|
| (4) Limiting collection | The Streamdal [SDK](/en/core-components/sdk/) can enforce [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) on [consumers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer) and [producers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer) to reject or alert on data if it contains more personal data than what is necessary, ensuring data minimization.|
| (6) Accuracy | [Rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) and [Pipelines](/en/resources-support/glossary/#pipeline-or-ruleset) can be attached to [producers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer) and [consumers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer) to ensure data is valid and accurate and alert for anomalies. <br /><br />For example, you could create [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) to filter for `e-mail address`, `phone number`, `IP address`, and other sensitive fiends like those listed above in our [approach](/en/data-governance/compliance/pipeda#streamdals-approach), and much more to ensure data is valid. |
| (7) Safeguards | You can physically apply your data safeguards to [producers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#producer) and [consumers](/en/resources-support/glossary/#consumer) handling sensitive data by creating [rules](/en/resources-support/glossary/#rule-or-step) and attaching them as [pipelines](/en/resources-support/glossary/#pipeline-or-ruleset). <br /><br />From the [Console UI](/en/core-components/console-ui/) (or [Streamdal CLI](/en/guides/tail/#cli)), you can periodically audit real-time data with [Tail](/en/guides/tail/) to ensure data is flowing within the necessary safeguards. |

    _The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada suggests the following 
    checklist for ensuring data accuracy:_
    
    - _List the specific items of personal information you need to provide a service._
    - _List where all related personal information can be found._
    - _Record the date when the personal information was obtained or updated._
    - _Record the steps taken to verify the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the information. This may require reviewing your records or communicating with your customer[^2]._

Welcome to the Python Client Guide for Streamdal! If you're leveraging the power of Python and aim to enhance your data operations, you're on the right track. Integrating Streamdal into your Python applications is both efficient and straightforward with our Python SDK.

## Insturmentation

Start with the [instrumentation doc](../../guides/instrumentation) if you haven't already. It will walk you through the process of setting up Streamdal and its components. 

## Getting Started

1. Install the SDK package:
```bash
python -m pip install streamdal

Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.8 or later installed on your system.

Dive Into an Example
Here's a basic example to help you get started with Streamdal Python SDK:

```bash
import pprint
from streamdal import (OPERATION_TYPE_CONSUMER, ProcessRequest, StreamdalClient, StreamdalConfig)

client = StreamdalClient(
    cfg=StreamdalConfig(
        service_name="order-ingest",
        streamdal_url="streamdal-server.svc.cluster.local:8082",
        streamdal_token="1234",
    )
)

res = client.process(
    ProcessRequest(
        operation_type=OPERATION_TYPE_CONSUMER,
        operation_name="new-order-topic",
        component_name="kafka",
        data=b'{"object": {"field": true}}',
    )
)

pprint.pprint(res)
```

This example demonstrates how to initialize a new instance of the Streamdal SDK, and how to process data through a method call. You simply need to create a configuration object and a process request object, and then call the process method on a new Streamdal instance. The result will be printed to the console.
